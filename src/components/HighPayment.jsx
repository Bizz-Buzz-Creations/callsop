        <strong>Right!</strong> You are making such high payments. Are you compromising with your expenses or are you fine with these payments?
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Because as I can see, some part of these repayments is simply going toward the high interest and charges. That’s the only reason your principal amount is coming down but very slowly.
        <br />
        <strong>Have you ever noticed that?</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Don’t worry sir — we’re going to drop your high interest and charges completely to <strong>0%</strong>, so whatever amount you pay will directly deduct from your principal amount. This will help you become debt-free in a shorter period of time.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Also, we will explore the possibility of writing off some part of your debts as well.

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        To give you a clearer picture of which program you can qualify for and what minimum payment plan is best suited for you, I’m going to process the application further. I’ll also explain all the <strong>benefits</strong> and <strong>drawbacks</strong> of the solution so that you can make an informed decision.

        So, talking about these debts — what sort of debts are these? Are these <strong>credit cards</strong>, <strong>loans</strong>, or a bit of both?
